# **Project Description**

## **Overview**
This case is about as an analyst for the telecommunications operator **Megaline**. The company offers its customers two prepaid plans:

- **Surf**
- **Ultimate**

The marketing department wants to know **which plan generates more revenue** so that they can adjust their advertising budget accordingly.

## **Objective**
Your task is to perform a **preliminary analysis** of the two plans based on a selection of **500 Megaline customers**. The provided data includes:

- Who the customers are
- Where they are from
- Which plan they use
- How many calls they made
- How many text messages they sent in **2018**

**What do you need to do?**

1. **Analyze customer behavior.**
2. **Determine which plan generates more revenue.**

This analysis will be done using **statistical analysis**, where tests will be conducted to determine which plan, on average, generates more revenue.
