# Data_Analyst_Projects

This project focuses on data cleaning and report preparation, aiming to analyze the shopping habits of Instacart customers, a grocery delivery platform similar to Uber Eats. The dataset includes several CSV files, such as instacart_orders.csv, products.csv, order_products.csv, aisles.csv, and departments.csv, which contain detailed information on customer orders, products, and categories.

The goal is to clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates. After preprocessing, the project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations. The tasks include examining the distribution of order times, analyzing purchase patterns, and identifying the most frequently ordered products. Additionally, the project asks to analyze the differences in order distribution between days, track how often products are reordered, and determine the most popular items customers add to their carts first.

The dataset was originally released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition, and the provided version has been modified for efficiency, including missing and duplicated values. The project involves creating informative visualizations and writing explanations of the results using Python and Pandas.
